## Description

KATA-CHI-KANA is a service that enables users to input Japanese Katakana characters by their shapes.
It is designed for learners who have not yet memorized the 50 basic sounds of Hiragana or who struggle to associate characters with their corresponding sounds.
While not a comprehensive learning support service, its purpose is to offer a gamified approach to learning.

## Why We Created KATA-CHI-KANA

The predominant methods for inputting Japanese text are flick input and Romanized input.
Flick input requires memorizing the 50 basic sounds, whereas Romanized input demands an understanding of phonetic representation.
We embarked on creating KATA-CHI-KANA to explore alternative input methods beyond these two.
Furthermore, we aimed to make the learning of Japanese characters an enjoyable experience for foreign learners of the language.

## How to Input

To input characters, follow the stroke order and tap on the shapes.
The service provides Katakana suggestions based on your input.

## References

We drew inspiration primarily from the 'Cangjie Input Method,' a Chinese character input method widely used in Hong Kong, and the 'Cheonjiin' input method for Hangeul, commonly used in South Korea.
We devised rules for forming Katakana characters by extracting simple and versatile components.
